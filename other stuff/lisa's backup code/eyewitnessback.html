<p>According to a Senior Official at NASA, The Mars Rover "Opportunity" was on one of its final sorties near the Gustav Crater <!-- make Crater clickable to show image--> earlier today when its highly sensitive sonar tracking capabilities and heat imaging technology started responding frenetically. At first the Mission Control thought "Opportunity" was showing her age by having some system failures. But the old gal is still in prime condition! Her sensors picked up the trail of some sort of life force just beyond the crater's edge. There the Rover discovered a water mass (named today by the NASA team as "The Sea of Tranquility"). Further reconnaissance by the unmanned Mini-Rover "Spider" over the past week has provided more information about Mars and its inhabitants than has been gathered in the past 10 years combined! "Spider" visually observed cave-like structures inhabited by<span style="color:#25BA28;font-size 2em;"> MARTIANS</span>!.</p>

<p>Now NASA is sending six leading language and mathematical experts to Mars! Apparently, our advancemnts in space exploration are much further along than the general public had heretofore been led to believe! NASA ALREADY HAS 3 FULLY OPERATIONAL MARS SHUTTLES READY FOR LAUNCH! Three teams of 8 (6 astronauts, 1 language expert and 1 mathematician) will be blasting off from Cape Canaveral on April 26th, 27th and 28th. These unprecedented missions to Mars aim to engage the Mars Lifeforce FACE TO FACE - HUMAN TO MARTIAN!!!.</p>
 
<p> NASA Astronauts have believed in extraterrestrials for decades! One report from "The Sun" states that Astronauts have seen UFOs while flying through space.<
