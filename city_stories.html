            <p>After an unsuccessful robbery attempt and a brief stand-off with police at a Brooklyn bank, 42 year-old Anthony Mayer was taken into custody Wednesday afternoon. A vigilant security guard said the suspect first aroused suspicion after spending
                nearly five minutes trying to maneuver a minivan towing a hot dog cart in the parking lot. Shortly thereafter security cameras show Mr. Mayer entering the bank. While waiting in line for the next available teller he appears nervous, fidgety
                and seems preoccupied with a large fanny-pack strapped to his belt.</p>

            <p>At 3:18 Mayer approaches a window and hands the teller a note. A statement later released by the bank states that it was written on a mustard-stained paper napkin and demanded "$289,500 in unmarked bills". Mayer then showed the teller the
                content of the fanny-pack allegedly claiming that it contained four sticks of dynamite and a detonator. The teller later remarked that the "bomb" looked suspiciously like a package of uncooked sausages wrapped in a cell phone charger.</p>

            <p>Unbeknownst to Mr. Mayer, at that moment a police cruiser was pulling into the parking lot to investigate a report of a "flaming hot dog cart". Apparently the propane tank used to heat the cart's cooking apparatus had somehow ignited.</p>

            <p>Upon seeing the cops and his fire-engulfed vending stand the aspiring bank robber began sobbing uncontrollably, threw his hands up in the air and surrendered.</p>

            <p>Police later disclosed that Mayer claimed he needed the $289,500 to pay for a one-year city permit to operate his hot dog stand in Central Park. This <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/nyregion/the-six-figure-price-tag-for-selling-a-two-dollar-hot-dog.html">New York Times article</a>                corroborates the price of such a permit.</p>
