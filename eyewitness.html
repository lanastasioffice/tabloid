            <p>According to a Senior Official at NASA, The Mars Rover "Opportunity" was on one of its final sorties near the Gustav Crater
                <!-- make Crater clickable to show image-->early yesterday when its highly sensitive sonar tracking and heat imaging technology started responding frenetically. At first Mission Control thought "Opportunity" was showing her age by having system failures. But the old gal is still
                in prime condition! Her sensors picked up the trail of some sort of life-force just beyond the crater's edge. There the Rover discovered a water mass (named today by the NASA team as "The Sea of Tranquility"). Further reconnaissance by
                the unmanned Mini-Rover "Spider" throughout the night has provided more information about Mars and its inhabitants than has been gathered in the past 10 years combined! "Spider" visually observed cave-like structures inhabited by
                <span style="color:#25BA28;font-size 2em;"> MARTIANS</span>!.</p>

            <p>NASA is sending six leading language and mathematical experts to Mars! Apparently, our advancements in space exploration are much further along than the general public had heretofore been led to believe! NASA ALREADY HAS 3 FULLY OPERATIONAL
                MARS SHUTTLES READY FOR LAUNCH! Three teams of 8 (6 astronauts, 1 language expert and 1 mathematician) will be blasting off from Cape Canaveral on April 29th, 30th and May 1, 2017. These unprecedented missions to Mars aim to engage the
                Mars Life-force FACE TO FACE - HUMAN TO MARTIAN!!!.</p>
