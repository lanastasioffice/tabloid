                <p>The Actress who plays Doreen on the hit show "<i>She's So Cool,</i>" Laura D'Montique, is confirmed to be aledgedly dating a known martian who goes by the alias "Julian Romero." Sources have not confirmed if the star herself knows she's
                    dealing with a citizen of Planet X246-9.</p>

                <p>D'Montique and her hot alien bae were spotted by our team of photographers who were able to catch the two lovebirds in an affectionate embrace... but he forgot to hide his alien form! His "status" as a visitor from another planet apparently
                    must not be a dealbreaker for the star.</p>
                <p>Close friends of the pair say that the two have been dating for 2 weeks, and she's already pressuring him to meet his parents! They also say that he treats her very well.</p>
                <p>D'Montique's representatives could not be reached at the time of this article's publication in order to give an official response to this serious matter, so we will just have to speculate.</p>
                <p>Will they last? Are children on the horizon for these two? The Gossip Queen will be sure keep an eye out for any updates on this juicy story. Good luck to the lovely couple!</p>
